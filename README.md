## 👍Recommendations

Based on the insights, here are the recommendations :
- Add movie showings with ratings (Tv-MA and R) in African countries with a movie duration of 2 hours.
  
- Add TV shows with a duration of 1 season only from the TV-MA rating.
  
- Adding new content and ratings in African countries: by adding more content and ratings in countries in the African region, more and more audiences will be interested in watching films from the African region.
  
- Market Trends: Stay updated on industry trends, both globally and locally. Trends in content consumption, technology, and audience behavior can inform content development strategies. For instance, if short-form content is trending, consider producing more short films or series.

**🌟 Additional Recommendation**
- Diverse Content Portfolio: To emulate the success of the United States in content creation, African countries should aim for a diverse content portfolio. This means developing content in various genres such as drama, comedy, thriller, science fiction, historical, and more. A diverse portfolio attracts a wide range of viewers with different preferences.
  
- Collaborations and Partnerships: Collaboration with international production studios, experienced filmmakers, and co-production opportunities can facilitate the creation of high-quality content. Partnerships can also provide access to funding, expertise, and global distribution networks.
  
- Content Promotion and Marketing: Effective marketing and promotion strategies are essential for showcasing African content to a global audience. Social media campaigns, advertising, and promotional events can generate excitement and awareness.
